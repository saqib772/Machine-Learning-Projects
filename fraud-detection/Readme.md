### Fraud Detection System with Flask

# Step 1: Install Required Packages
Firstly, you need to install some Python packages that will be used in this project. You can use pip package manager to install the following packages:

1. Flask: A web framework to create the backend of the application.

2. pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

3. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for building predictive models

# Step 2: Create a Flask App
Next, you need to create a Flask app. Flask is a lightweight web framework that allows you to create web applications quickly and easily.

# Step 3: Create a Form for Data Input
Now, you need to create a form that allows users to input data. In this case, we will use a CSV file as the data source.

# Step 4: Process the Uploaded Data
Next, you need to process the uploaded CSV file. In this case, we will use pandas library to read the CSV file and convert it into a pandas DataFrame.

# Step 5: Build a Fraud Detection Model (Continued)
To build a fraud detection model, you need to first prepare the data. In this case, we will assume that the CSV file contains data on online payment transactions, including features such as transaction amount, type of payment method used, and the country where the payment was made.
